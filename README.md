# circletosquare
This program converts a set of circle coordinates (coordinates underneath the line of a circle with a given radius), into a transformed set of coordinates based on a square with the same diameter (-256 <= x <= 256, -256 <= y <= 256).

The purpose of this was to see how I would convert a joystick which has the wrong maximum inputs, as a circle, and map them onto correct maximum inputs, as a square.
